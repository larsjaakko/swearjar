# swearjar
Automatic swearword generator in Norwegian.

Generated words are endocentric compounds consisting of a random head and modifier combination. Heads and modifiers are categorized into three classes of increasing NSFW-ness; Nun, Normal and Northeners.

## Frameworks
Built on Django, Django-REST, Skeleton and React.js.

## Live demo
The project is live on http://banneord.no

## Disclaimer
If you're offended by foul language, that is unfortunate.

## TODO
* Implement FB share button
* Extend API and models to allow POST of generated swearwords
* Allow users to like/vote for swearwords
* Make a highscore list/hall of fame
* Improve category selection (possibly using http://react-component.github.io/slider/)
